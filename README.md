### COVID-19 and Happiness: A Comparative Analysis between Developing and Developed Countries
The COVID-19 pandemic brought dramatic and often distressing changes to peopleâ€™s lives worldwide. With lockdowns, mask mandates, and travel restrictions, our normal activities were halted, leading to heightened stress, anxiety, and uncertainty for many. Beyond the physical health crisis, COVID-19 also struck at a crucial marker of social well-being happiness. Happiness, as gauged by well-being assessments like the World Happiness Report, is a key indicator of societal health. This project is an exploration of how the pandemic affected happiness worldwide, with a special focus on the differences between developed and developing nations.

#### Research Questions
##### Primary Question
To what extent did the COVID-19 pandemic influence global happiness levels?

##### Secondary Question
How did the effects of COVID-19 on happiness differ between developed and developing nations?

These questions guide an analysis aimed at uncovering the social impact of the pandemic. By examining happiness scores before and during the pandemic, we can gain a better understanding of its broader effects on well-being across different socioeconomic contexts.

#### Project Goals
The objective of this analysis is to capture and quantify the effect of COVID-19 on happiness worldwide. By comparing pre- and post-pandemic happiness scores, we aim to identify key patterns and divergences between developed and developing countries. This information could be vital for policymakers, sociologists, and public health experts looking to bolster societal resilience in future global crises.

#### Data Sources
To conduct this analysis, I used two primary datasets:

World Happiness Report Data (2015-2020): This dataset provided happiness scores and metrics such as GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy for a range of countries. It offered a baseline for understanding happiness trends in the years leading up to and during the pandemic.

COVID-19 Case Data: Sourced from global health repositories, this data includes case counts, recoveries, and deaths across countries, allowing us to map COVID-19 severity to shifts in happiness.

#### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning was performed to ensure consistency and accuracy across datasets. The following steps were undertaken:

Removed duplicates to prevent skewed results.
Filtered out unnecessary columns to streamline the analysis.
Standardized column names to ensure uniformity across different datasets.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
